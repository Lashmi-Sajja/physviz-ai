## CHANGES ##

Change kiro to physviz-ai
Increase font of text
When cursor goes onto What-ifs and parameters they should popout with a glow background
Place what-ifs and parameters to the right of the simulator
add the text boxes in the free space 


## example for the text box pop ups ##

Predictive Scenarios
What if speed doubles?

• max height change: 4x increase (quadratic)

• flight time change: 2x increase (linear)

• energy change: 4x increase

• formula: h ∝ v²

What if mass doubles?

• max height change: No change

• flight time change: No change

• energy change: 2x increase

• formula: h independent of mass

Concept Insights
⚡
Energy Conserved!

Total energy stays constant at 25.00 J. KE converts to PE and back.

💡
Peak Reached!

Velocity becomes zero at the highest point - a key characteristic of projectile motion.
