# Core Problem Types

## 1D Motion Problems
* Objects moving in a straight line with constant velocity or constant acceleration
* Free fall problems
* Vertical motion (throwing objects up/down)

## 2D Motion Problems
* Projectile motion (objects launched at angles)
* Motion on inclined planes
* Relative velocity problems (boats crossing rivers, airplane wind scenarios)

## Circular Motion
* Uniform circular motion with constant speed
* Finding angular velocity, centripetal acceleration
* Motion along curved paths
